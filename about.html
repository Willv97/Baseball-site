        <h2>Meet Bob Olah</h2>
        <p class="tagline">Over 40 Years of Baseball Experience</p>
        <p>From little league to pro softball â€” Bob Olah has done it all. A semi-pro slugger turned coach, Bob brings decades of real-world playing and training experience to athletes of all ages.</p>

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Iâ€™ve been swinging bats for 37+ years â€” playing, coaching, and training across every level of baseball. At 17, I hit a home run in Yankee Stadium. I was drafted by the New York Mets. I even had the chance to play for Michael Boltonâ€™s team. My journey has taken me across leagues and locker rooms, and Iâ€™ve seen firsthand what it takes to succeed in this game.</p>

      <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve met and trained with elite athletes, dealt with my share of injuries, and learned the hard lessons that every ballplayer faces. Thatâ€™s why I built this site â€” to cut the fluff and give you real tools that actually work.</p>
