        <h2>Meet Bob Olah</h2>
        <p class="tagline">Over 40 Years of Baseball Experience</p>
        <p>From little league to pro softball — Bob Olah has done it all. A semi-pro slugger turned coach, Bob brings decades of real-world playing and training experience to athletes of all ages.</p>

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>I’ve been swinging bats for 37+ years — playing, coaching, and training across every level of baseball. At 17, I hit a home run in Yankee Stadium. I was drafted by the New York Mets. I even had the chance to play for Michael Bolton’s team. My journey has taken me across leagues and locker rooms, and I’ve seen firsthand what it takes to succeed in this game.</p>

      <p>Over the years, I’ve met and trained with elite athletes, dealt with my share of injuries, and learned the hard lessons that every ballplayer faces. That’s why I built this site — to cut the fluff and give you real tools that actually work.</p>
